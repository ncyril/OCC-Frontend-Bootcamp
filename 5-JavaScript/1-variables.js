// Statements: JavaScript code is composed of statements that perform specific actions. Each statement typically ends with a semicolon (;), although it is not always required.

// Comments: You can add comments in JavaScript to provide explanations or make notes within the code. There are two types of comments: single-line comments, starting with //, and multi-line comments, enclosed between /* and */.

// Case sensitivity: JavaScript is case-sensitive, meaning that uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. For example, "variable" and "Variable" would be considered as two separate variables.

// Whitespace: JavaScript ignores spaces, tabs, and line breaks (collectively called whitespace) that are not necessary for code execution. However, whitespace can enhance code readability.

// Blocks: Code blocks in JavaScript are enclosed in curly braces ({}) and are used to group statements together. Blocks are often used in control structures like loops and conditional statements.

//Variables
